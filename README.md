C# Win Form Expression Parsing and Evaluation Tool with Data Structures and Algorithms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Introduction:**

This GitHub repository houses a C# Windows Forms project that focuses on the critical processes of parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions. By utilizing foundational data structures and algorithms, this project showcases how these fundamental components can be leveraged to handle complex expression processing effectively.

**Core Features:**

1. **Recursive Descent Parsing:**
   The heart of this project lies in the implementation of a recursive descent parser. This parsing technique is employed to carefully validate the syntax of input expression strings. It dissects complex expressions into smaller components, aiding in the identification of any syntax errors.

2. **Stack-Based Expression Evaluation:**
   To evaluate expressions accurately and efficiently, the project employs a stack-based evaluation approach. This method involves converting the input infix expression into a postfix notation. This conversion ensures that operator precedence is correctly considered during the evaluation process. The stack plays a pivotal role in managing the order of operations.

3. **Operator Precedence Handling:**
   During expression evaluation, it's essential to account for the precedence of operators. This project ensures that expressions are evaluated according to mathematical rules, with operators having their appropriate influence on the result.

**How Data Structures and Algorithms Come Into Play:**

1. **Stacks:**
   Stacks, a foundational data structure, play a central role in multiple aspects of this project. They are instrumental in both the postfix conversion process and the evaluation of expressions. Stacks provide a systematic way to manage operators, operands, and their relationships during these processes.

2. **Recursion:**
   The concept of recursion is harnessed to implement the recursive descent parser. Recursive functions break down intricate expressions into simpler subcomponents, aiding in systematic syntax analysis. This technique enhances the readability and maintainability of the parser's code.

**Exploring the Project:**

If you're keen on understanding how these elements work together harmoniously, delve into the project's codebase. Here, you'll find comprehensive examples of how the recursive descent parser, stack-based evaluation, and operator precedence handling collaborate to create a robust expression parsing and evaluation tool.

This repository serves as an educational resource for those interested in delving into the intricacies of expression processing, parsing techniques, and the application of data structures and algorithms in real-world scenarios.
